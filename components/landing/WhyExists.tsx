            The Americas function as one economic theater. Yet healthcare systems remain
            divided by borders that families, physicians, and institutions routinely cross.
            Medikah exists to resolve this structural contradiction.

            Medikah provides the coordination infrastructure these realities
            require&mdash;not as innovation, but as institutional necessity.
