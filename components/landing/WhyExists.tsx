          Why Medikah Exists
        </h2>

        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p className="text-lg text-body-slate leading-[1.7]">
            The Americas have been one economic theater for decades&mdash;but healthcare
            systems remain artificially divided. While families live between countries,
            medical records stop at borders. While physicians train across the hemisphere,
            licensing creates walls. While employers manage multinational workforces,
            coverage fragments at every boundary.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-body-slate leading-[1.7]">
            Medikah was established to build the coordination infrastructure these
            realities demand. Not as disruption, but as recognition of what healthcare
            has become&mdash;and what it must evolve to serve.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-body-slate leading-[1.7]">
            Medikah&rsquo;s architecture reflects decades of lived fluency across U.S. and
            Latin American healthcare systems&mdash;where families, physicians, and institutions
            routinely operate on both sides of the border, even when policy and
            infrastructure do not.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-deep-charcoal leading-[1.7] mt-8">
            Medikah was conceived through the initiatives and institutional frameworks
            of BeNeXT Global and launched as an independent Pan-American health
            infrastructure. We coordinate what should never have been separated.
